            <p> The Spider-Verse is connected by the Web of Life and Destiny. This is a subsection of the Marvel multiverse that connects all versions of Spider-Man from across the multiverse in a series of shared events and attributes. The idea is that every universe that has a Spider hero they are part of this great web.
                <br>
                <br>
                It is basically represented as a web, but the points in which they converge in the web are events that must happen to every version of a Spider-Man. These events are represented as "the canon" or "the canon event" - Canon events must happen, and if they are disrupted can result in the destruction of another universe or the universe itself. This explains why across various Spider-Man movies, certain recurring elements always play out the same, like the death of aunt May, uncle Ben, or their best friends. This also means that even if you, as an audience, did not see it happen to a Spider-Man in the movies, it still happened and it still must happen. 
                <br>
                <br>
                In short, the Spider-Verse is kind of a loose name for all the different Spider-Men and Spider-Women from all the different alternate universes in Marvel. At various points over the last several years, multiple universes' versions of Spider-Man have met, fought together, and sometimes died in battle against enemies.
